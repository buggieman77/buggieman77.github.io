<h1 align="center">🧑‍💻 My Portofolio 💻🧑</h1>

Hi! I am a beginner developer who is building experience in the world of programming and web development. This portfolio contains several projects that I have worked on while studying, ranging from static websites, simple applications, to projects using JavaScript and frameworks such as React.

Each project is the result of my learning process, starting from understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, to exploring technologies such as Git, API, and deployment.

I continue to learn and am open to input and collaboration opportunities so that I can develop further as a developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
